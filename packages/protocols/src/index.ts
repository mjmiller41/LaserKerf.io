/**
 * protocols — machine-control codecs (grbl, ruida, galvo/ezcad).

 * Scaffold for M0. Codecs are pure, transport-agnostic byte encoders/decoders
 * (no I/O — that belongs to `device-core` transports and the Agent). GRBL lands
 * in M2, Ruida in M4, galvo in M7. Each codec is validated by the conformance
 * harness below against captured/emulator fixtures.
